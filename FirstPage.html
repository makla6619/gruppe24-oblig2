          <p>
            In September 1993, fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) 
            made their broadcast TV debut on The X-Files and went on to investigate alien abductions and all manner of strange 
            phenomena for nine full seasons and two feature films, followed by two additional limited-run seasons in 2016 and 2018. 
            This hugely popular and influential series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, giving us a prime opportunity to 
            pay homage to our favorite episodes and characters.
          </p>

            <a class="spoilers">
              (Spoilers for 
              <em>
                The X-Files
              </em>
              below)  
            </a>

          <p>
            The X-Files was created by Chris Carter, who was a fan of the 1970s horror series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, featuring a 
            wire service reporter (Darren McGavin) investigating mysterious crimes with a supernatural or science fiction element. Other 
            cited influences included The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Twin Peaks (in which Duchovny played a transgender DEA agent), and 
            Jonathan Demme's 1988 Oscar-winning film The Silence of the Lambs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carter liked the idea of a TV series featuring FBI agents investigating the paranormal. He deliberately made Mulder 
            (nicknamed "Spooky") the true believer and Scully the science-based skeptic—a gender swap to counter broad cultural stereotypes. 
            Carter described the pair as a dichotomy, representing his desire to believe in something versus an inability to believe—the age-old 
            tension between skepticism and faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the characters developed over subsequent seasons, we saw them internalize that tension, with Mulder sometimes getting discouraged 
            and questioning his longing to believe and Scully being forced to confront how her science sometimes conflicted with her devout 
            Catholic faith. They each had deep personal journeys as well; both lost family members, for instance, and Mulder's obsession with 
            alien abductions was fueled by the disappearance of his sister Samantha when he was a kid. And while Carter was adamant early on 
            that this would be a purely platonic relationship—à la Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers British TV series—that changed as the 
            friendship between Mulder and Scully deepened, with increasingly romantic overtones. But the series never openly acknowledged the two 
            having sex until season 11's "Plus One."

          <p>Likewise, there are several MOW episodes that are worthy of honorable mention. Who could forget Zelijko Ivanek's incredible 
            performance as a mentally disabled janitor for a science lab in "Roland" (S1)? <br>Tony Shalhoub was equally terrific as a physicist 
            haunted by his own shadow in "Soft Light" (S2), despite the nonsensical physics. <br>"All Souls" (S5) showcased Scully struggling 
            with grief over the loss of her daughter, while "Elegy" (S4) and "Tithonus" (S6) continued Scully's emotional arc concerning 
            her faith and human mortality.<br>
        
            It's equally tough to forget the disturbing "Home" (S4), which featured a squicky incest-centric plot that warranted the show's 
            first TV-MA rating. <br>The concept of a meteorologist whose repressed emotions affect the weather made "The Rain King" (S6) 
            stand out, while the heist caper of S7's "The Amazing Maleeni," featuring real-world magician Ricky Jay <br>, was a refreshing change 
            of pace from the show's usual fare. <br> The S7 satirical episode "Hollywood A.D." (penned by Duchovny) also provided a playful 
            respite, though it was marred by a rather silly subplot. <br> And who could forget the William Gibson-penned "First Person Shooter" 
            (S7), in which Mulder and Scully suit up to battle a renegade killer avatar in a VR game?</p>
