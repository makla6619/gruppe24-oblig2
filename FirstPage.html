  <p>Likewise, there are several MOW episodes that are worthy of honorable mention. Who could forget Zelijko Ivanek's incredible 
    performance as a mentally disabled janitor for a science lab in "Roland" (S1)? <br>Tony Shalhoub was equally terrific as a physicist 
    haunted by his own shadow in "Soft Light" (S2), despite the nonsensical physics. <br>"All Souls" (S5) showcased Scully struggling 
    with grief over the loss of her daughter, while "Elegy" (S4) and "Tithonus" (S6) continued Scully's emotional arc concerning 
    her faith and human mortality.<br>

    It's equally tough to forget the disturbing "Home" (S4), which featured a squicky incest-centric plot that warranted the show's 
    first TV-MA rating. <br>The concept of a meteorologist whose repressed emotions affect the weather made "The Rain King" (S6) 
    stand out, while the heist caper of S7's "The Amazing Maleeni," featuring real-world magician Ricky Jay <br>, was a refreshing change 
    of pace from the show's usual fare. <br> The S7 satirical episode "Hollywood A.D." (penned by Duchovny) also provided a playful 
    respite, though it was marred by a rather silly subplot. <br> And who could forget the William Gibson-penned "First Person Shooter" 
    (S7), in which Mulder and Scully suit up to battle a renegade killer avatar in a VR game?</p>
