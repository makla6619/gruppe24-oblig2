          <p>
            In September 1993, fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) 
            made their broadcast TV debut on The X-Files and went on to investigate alien abductions and all manner of strange 
            phenomena for nine full seasons and two feature films, followed by two additional limited-run seasons in 2016 and 2018. 
            This hugely popular and influential series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, giving us a prime opportunity to 
            pay homage to our favorite episodes and characters.
          </p>

            <a class="spoilers">
              (Spoilers for 
              <em>
                The X-Files
              </em>
              below)  
            </a>

          <p>
            The X-Files was created by Chris Carter, who was a fan of the 1970s horror series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, featuring a 
            wire service reporter (Darren McGavin) investigating mysterious crimes with a supernatural or science fiction element. Other 
            cited influences included The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Twin Peaks (in which Duchovny played a transgender DEA agent), and 
            Jonathan Demme's 1988 Oscar-winning film The Silence of the Lambs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carter liked the idea of a TV series featuring FBI agents investigating the paranormal. He deliberately made Mulder 
            (nicknamed "Spooky") the true believer and Scully the science-based skeptic—a gender swap to counter broad cultural stereotypes. 
            Carter described the pair as a dichotomy, representing his desire to believe in something versus an inability to believe—the age-old 
            tension between skepticism and faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the characters developed over subsequent seasons, we saw them internalize that tension, with Mulder sometimes getting discouraged 
            and questioning his longing to believe and Scully being forced to confront how her science sometimes conflicted with her devout 
            Catholic faith. They each had deep personal journeys as well; both lost family members, for instance, and Mulder's obsession with 
            alien abductions was fueled by the disappearance of his sister Samantha when he was a kid. And while Carter was adamant early on 
            that this would be a purely platonic relationship—à la Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers British TV series—that changed as the 
            friendship between Mulder and Scully deepened, with increasingly romantic overtones. But the series never openly acknowledged the two 
            having sex until season 11's "Plus One."
