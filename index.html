      <div class="text-one">
        <p>
          In September 1993, fictional FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David
          Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) made their broadcast TV
          debut on The X-Files and went on to investigate alien abductions and
          all manner of strange phenomena for nine full seasons and two feature
          films, followed by two additional limited-run seasons in 2016 and
          2018. This hugely popular and influential series celebrates its 30th
          anniversary this month, giving us a prime opportunity to pay homage to
          our favorite episodes and characters.
        </p>

        <a class="spoilers">
          (Spoilers for
          <em> The X-Files </em>
          below)
        </a>

        <p>
          The X-Files was created by Chris Carter, who was a fan of the 1970s
          horror series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, featuring a wire service
          reporter (Darren McGavin) investigating mysterious crimes with a
          supernatural or science fiction element. Other cited influences
          included The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Twin Peaks (in which
          Duchovny played a transgender DEA agent), and Jonathan Demme's 1988
          Oscar-winning film The Silence of the Lambs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carter liked the idea of a TV series featuring FBI agents
          investigating the paranormal. He deliberately made Mulder (nicknamed
          "Spooky") the true believer and Scully the science-based skeptic—a
          gender swap to counter broad cultural stereotypes. Carter described
          the pair as a dichotomy, representing his desire to believe in
          something versus an inability to believe—the age-old tension between
          skepticism and faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the characters developed over subsequent seasons, we saw them
          internalize that tension, with Mulder sometimes getting discouraged
          and questioning his longing to believe and Scully being forced to
          confront how her science sometimes conflicted with her devout Catholic
          faith. They each had deep personal journeys as well; both lost family
          members, for instance, and Mulder's obsession with alien abductions
          was fueled by the disappearance of his sister Samantha when he was a
          kid. And while Carter was adamant early on that this would be a purely
          platonic relationship—à la Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers
          British TV series—that changed as the friendship between Mulder and
          Scully deepened, with increasingly romantic overtones. But the series
          never openly acknowledged the two having sex until season 11's "Plus
          One."

          The Lone Gunmen were introduced in the S1 episode "E.B.E." and soon
          became fan favorites.

        </p>

        <p>
          The X-Files quickly blossomed from a cult series into a bona fide pop
          culture phenomenon throughout its first seven seasons, racking up a
          lot of Emmy and Golden Globe awards. Scully is often credited with
          encouraging young women to pursue careers in medicine, science, or the
          FBI, a phenomenon dubbed the "Scully effect."
        </p>

        <p>
          While it started out dealing with UFOs and alien abduction, Carter and
          his writing team realized early on that it would be difficult to
          sustain that momentum over multiple seasons. So there were essentially
          two kinds of episodes: those advancing the over-arching "mytharc" of
          the series canon—often featuring appearances by William B. Davis as
          the iconic Cigarette Smoking Man (CSM)—and standalone "Monster of the
          Week" (MOW) episodes unrelated to the series mythology. From horror to
          humor, shadowy conspiracies to arcane folklore, the series offered
          something for everyone, a key factor in its broad popular appeal.
        </p>

        <h2 class="last-sub-heading">“The Seasons That Shall Not Be Named”</h2>

        <p>
          For the first five seasons, The X-Files filmed in Vancouver, British
          Columbia, but it moved to Los Angeles starting with the sixth season
          so that Duchovny could be closer to his then-wife Tea Leoni. When
          Duchovny's contract expired after the seventh season, he effectively
          quit the series, though he returned occasionally as Mulder during S8
          and S9—or, as I like to call them, "The Seasons That Shall Not Be
          Named."
        </p>

        <p>
          This was unquestionably the low point of the series, especially with
          Anderson also winding down her involvement. Carter apparently
          convinced himself that he could simply find new leads—in this case,
          Robert Patrick as John Doggett and Annabeth Gish as Monica Reyes—and
          the show would run indefinitely. But there is simply no X-Files
          without Mulder and Scully. Add in the deaths of fan favorites the Lone
          Gunmen in "Jump the Shark" (S9), and no wonder ratings steeply
          declined.
        </p>

          The series introduced Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and John Doggett
          (Robert Patrick) as new leads for the eighth and ninth seasons. But
          there is no X-Files without Mulder and Scully, and ratings sharply
          declined.

        </p>

        <p>
          The show's original run ended with that ninth season. But The X-Files
          lived on via DVD and (more recently) streaming platforms, and its
          hardcore fan base remained fiercely loyal. The 2008 film The X-Files:
          I Want to Believe (with a standalone MOW plot) received mixed reviews
          and didn't exactly light up the box office, but it grossed $68 million
          against its $30 million budget. That was enough to spark rumors of a
          possible third film; both Duchovny and Anderson expressed a
          willingness to co-star.
        </p>

        <p>
          By 2015, the project had morphed into bringing The X-Files back as a
          limited-run TV series, with the six-episode S10 debuting in 2016.
          Mulder and Scully were reunited 14 years after the events of S9 as the
          FBI reopened the X-Files under Assistant Director Walter Skinner
          (Mitch Pileggi), a major recurring character in the series since his
          introduction in the S1 episode "Tooms." Reviews were mixed, especially
          regarding the weak mytharc episodes, but there were enough good
          episodes to warrant a follow-up ten-episode season in 2018, focusing
          on Mulder and Scully's search for their missing son, William. This was
          a much stronger season, with some very good episodes, but neither S10
          or S11 managed to fully recapture the old magic, and Anderson
          announced she wouldn't be returning to The X-Files shortly thereafter.
          As recently as 2020, Carter was on record expressing hopes of
          continuing the franchise without Mulder and Scully, but again—those
          characters are the heart and soul of The X-Files. Without them, it's
          just another spooky series.
        </p>

        <h2 class="last-sub-heading">Hard choices</h2>

        <p>
          It was no easy task to narrow this list down to just 30 episodes.
          X-Files fans can be roughly divided into two camps: those who love the
          standalone MOW episodes and those who jones for the alien conspiracy
          mytharc episodes. I belong to the former category, and this list
          inevitably reflects my subjective taste; I also tend to favor episodes
          where the writers took creative risks.

          The S11 episode "Plus One" was the first time Mulder and Scully were
          openly shown to be intimate.

        <p>
          There have been very good mythological episodes, of course, but they
          often spanned more than one episode in terms of narrative arc, and not
          all the episodes in a given arc were equally good. Even those who love
          them would admit that the mythology eventually spiraled out of
          control: black oil, shapeshifting alien bounty hunters, alien-human
          hybrids, smallpox vaccines, a shadowy Syndicate, something to do with
          bees... I'd pinpoint the downward slide into incoherence as beginning
          after S3's "Paper Clip," a mostly excellent episode that concluded a
          three-episode arc beginning with the S2 cliffhanger finale "Anasazi."
          "Paper Clip" also contains Skinner's most popular line, when he tells
          the CSM to "pucker up and kiss my ass."
        </p>

        <p>
          Other notable mythological episodes deserve honorable mention. In S1,
          "E.B.E." introduced us to the Lone Gunmen, while the season finale,
          "The Erlenmeyer Flask," shocked viewers with the death of Mulder's
          sketchy informant, Deep Throat. "Sleepless" (S2) gave us recurring
          villain Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), while the one-two punch of S3's
          "Piper Maru" and "Apocrypha" introduced the mysterious black oil.
          Scully's abduction in the critically acclaimed three-parter "Duane
          Barry," "Ascension," and "One Breath" (S2) was a clever way for the
          writers to work around Anderson's real-life pregnancy and set up some
          intriguing later developments in the series.
        </p>

        <p>
          While technically standalone episodes, "Conduit" (S1) and "Oubliette"
          (S3) delved deeper into Mulder's emotional scars from losing his
          sister Samantha. That storyline concluded—unsatisfactorily, in my
          opinion—with S7's "Sein und Zeit" and "Closure." I also enjoyed S5's
          two-parter "A Christmas Carol" and "Emily," in which Scully discovered
          that she gave birth to a daughter during her abduction. And the
          telepathic chess child prodigy Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) made for a
          compelling two-episode arc in "The End" (S5) and "The Beginning" (S6).

        <p>
          Likewise, there are several MOW episodes that are worthy of honorable
          mention. Who could forget Zelijko Ivanek's incredible performance as a
          mentally disabled janitor for a science lab in "Roland" (S1)? Tony
          Shalhoub was equally terrific as a physicist haunted by his own shadow
          in "Soft Light" (S2), despite the nonsensical physics. "All Souls"
          (S5) showcased Scully struggling with grief over the loss of her
          daughter, while "Elegy" (S4) and "Tithonus" (S6) continued Scully's
          emotional arc concerning her faith and human mortality.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's equally tough to forget the disturbing "Home" (S4), which
          featured a squicky incest-centric plot that warranted the show's first
          TV-MA rating. The concept of a meteorologist whose repressed emotions
          affect the weather made "The Rain King" (S6) stand out, while the
          heist caper of S7's "The Amazing Maleeni," featuring real-world
          magician Ricky Jay, was a refreshing change of pace from the show's
          usual fare. The S7 satirical episode "Hollywood A.D." (penned by
          Duchovny) also provided a playful respite, though it was marred by a
          rather silly subplot. And who could forget the William Gibson-penned
          "First Person Shooter" (S7), in which Mulder and Scully suit up to
          battle a renegade killer avatar in a VR game?
